                A group of 20 of us are planning to meet—will that be a problem?
                We are a small space with a capacity of 49 people. Depending on
                the night and time, it is very likely that everyone in your
                party will not be able to get in right away. On busy nights, we
                often have to run a line outside. If some of your group shows up
                an hour after others do, we can’t let them in before the other
                people in line who have been waiting. We do head counts and let
                as many people in as we can, but once we are at capacity,
                someone must leave for someone else to go in. If you want to
                bring a group, we suggest you keep your group fairly small, get
                to the bar early, and that you try to show up at roughly the
                same time. Explain to folks joining you that if they come late,
                they might have to wait in line. Another great option for your
                group might be to book out a private event - more information is
                available here.
