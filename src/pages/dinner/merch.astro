            Between hand printed yearly exclusive shirts and rotating custom
            stickers for all sorts of things, we have a variety of merch for you
            to choose from. Stop in to check out if we have anything special for
            the week!

            Big thanks to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_erikjean/">
                Erik
            </a> who prints our shirts &lt;3
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: most of our merch has a limited release and we do not keep
            extra stock from designs prior. If you see something you like, its a
            good idea to buy it before its gone and lost to the sands of time.
