    <h1>About</h1>
    <div>
        <p> A group of 20 of us are planning to meet—will that be a problem?
            We are a small space with a capacity of 49 people. Depending on the night and time, it is very likely that
            everyone in your party will not be able to get in right away. On busy nights, we often have to run a line
            outside. If some of your group shows up an hour after others do, we can’t let them in before the other
            people in line who have been waiting. We do head counts and let as many people in as we can, but once we are
            at capacity, someone must leave for someone else to go in. If you want to bring a group, we suggest you keep
            your group fairly small, get to the bar early, and that you try to show up at roughly the same time. Explain
            to folks joining you that if they come late, they might have to wait in line. Another great option for your
            group might be to book out a private event - more information is available here.</p>
